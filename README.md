# Vote-Era
Vote Era is an decentralize voting web application built using frontend of Web2.0 and backend of Web3.0

# Front-End 
Here we have used HTML,CSS & Javascript for Front End. But our goal here was to create a transparent voting app where the main play is of backend.

# Back-End
In backend along with javascript we have used solidity for making the smart contract which gets activated during the time of voting. Also the vote counting and update happens in the smart contract which is on ethereum blockchain.

Thus all in all it is used for transparent and decentralized voting app DApp which will be required in the near-future due to ongoing malicious practices in current centralized voting system.
